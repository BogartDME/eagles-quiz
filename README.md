Creating an application that givers a timed quiz about the Philadelphia Eagles

## Description

 This is an application that allowed me to work through many java script functions and apply them directly. Pressing the start button starts a function to start a countdown and reveals quiz questions. When one question is answered another question will appear, and if a question is answered incorrectly then time will be deducted off the timer. After the quiz is over the user will be able to input their initals and save their highscore.

## Access

## Roadmap

This quiz is still being worked on. The functions to start the countdown and pull up the questions is not currently working when the user clicks that start button, though the console log does display that the start button has been pressed Also I have not created the highscore feature of the application yet. All of these issues will be addressed and working smoothly in the future.
